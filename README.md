Game that take 2 digit number as an input from the user and than our app try to guess that number. 
We also have hint option where we tell user to give a hint whether the number is lower or higher from the number that our app guessed, if user give the wrong hint we alert the user with the wrong hint.
This project is associated with Academind.I have done some little bit changes on this app so its not the same as Academind but the idea was originated from there only.
